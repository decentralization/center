# Center

In this center, we aim at understanding how to build decentralized technologies, exploring their technical and social challenges. We aim at meeting digitally and physically every two weeks, starting February 2016.

> There is no such center, everyone is the center.
>
> __Start your center__ in your own university, workplace and community,
>
> to think, build and promote a more decentralized technology.
